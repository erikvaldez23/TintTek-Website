    {
      question: "Does residential window tinting improve energy efficiency?",

    },
    {
      question:
        "Does window film increase privacy at night if interior lights are on?",
      answer:
        "No, window tinting or window film generally does not provide increased privacy at night if your interior lights are on. At night, when it's darker outside than inside, light from your home can make it easier for people to see inside. However, darker or more reflective films may offer some degree of privacy during the day. For maximum nighttime privacy, we recommend using dual-reflective films or privacy films that are designed to reduce visibility both day and night.",
    },
    {

    {
      question: "Will paint correction remove all scratches and imperfections?",
      answer:
        "While paint correction can remove most swirl marks, light scratches, and other imperfections, it may not be able to eliminate very deep or severe scratches. The results depend on the depth of the defect and the condition of the paint. Our professionals will assess your vehicle and determine the best approach for optimal results.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does paint correction take?",
      answer:
        "The duration of paint correction depends on the vehicle's condition, size, and the level of correction required. It can take anywhere from 1 to 3 days. Our professionals will assess your vehicle and provide a detailed quotation during your meeting, ensuring the process meets your specific needs.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Do I need to apply a protective coating after paint correction?",
      answer:
        "After paint correction, applying a protective coating such as a wax, sealant, or ceramic coating is highly recommended. This will help protect the newly corrected paint from environmental elements, dirt, and scratches, keeping your vehicle looking great for longer.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I get paint correction done?",
      answer:
        "Paint correction is typically done when the vehicle’s paint shows significant imperfections that can't be corrected by regular washing or detailing. It’s not something that needs to be done regularly, but it can be a good idea if you notice defects in your paint or want to maintain the overall appearance of your vehicle.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is paint correction worth it before tint or ceramic coating in DFW?",
      answer:
        "Yes. If you’re protecting your vehicle with a ceramic coating or PPF, it’s best to correct the paint first so you’re not locking in imperfections. Many Dallas customers see it as a one-time investment to bring their car back to showroom condition.",

  "vehicle-paint-protection": [
    {
      question: "What is Paint Protection Film (PPF)?",

      question: "Can I add Paint Protection Film if my car has been painted? ",
      answer:
        "If your car has been repainted, please let us know before we apply a Paint Protection Film (PPF). The paint must be fully cured, typically requiring at least 30 days. If the paint is of poor quality or improperly applied, there's a risk that the PPF may not adhere properly, or it could cause the paint to peel when removed. Proper preparation and timing are key to achieving the best results, so consulting with a professional installer is important to ensure your vehicle is ready for PPF.",

      question: "Does ExoShield GT3 protect against all types of damage?",
      answer:
        "ExoShield GT3 significantly reduces the risk of damage from road debris, such as rocks, gravel, and other hazards. However, it is not a guarantee against all types of damage, such as large impacts or severe accidents. It provides additional protection but doesn't replace the need for careful driving.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I maintain my windshield after applying ExoShield GT3?",
      answer:

    {
      question: "Will ceramic coating prevent all scratches?",
      answer:
        "Ceramic coating adds a layer of protection against light scratches and swirl marks, but it cannot prevent all types of damage, especially deep scratches from sharp objects or accidents. It significantly reduces the risk of surface-level abrasions, though. PPF (Paint Protection Film)  is a great addition to fully protect your vehicle.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon can I drive my car after the coating is applied?",
      answer:
        "For best results, it's recommended to wait at least 24-48 hours after application before exposing the vehicle to water or driving in rain. This allows the coating to cure fully and bond to the surface.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I maintain my ceramic-coated vehicle?",
      answer: `Maintaining a ceramic-coated vehicle involves simple care:
        <ul>
          <li> Regularly wash with a pH-neutral shampoo to avoid degrading the coating. </li>
          <li> Use a microfiber towel to dry. </li>

    },
    {
      question: "Does ceramic coating replace PPF in Dallas traffic?",
      answer:
        "No — ceramic coating protects against environmental damage and makes cleaning easy, but it doesn’t stop rock chips or heavy scratches. Most of our DFW customers choose PPF for impact protection and ceramic coating on top for the best of both worlds.",
