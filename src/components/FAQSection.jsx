      answer:
        "No, window tinting or window film generally does not provide increased privacy at night if your interior lights are on. At night, when it's darker outside than inside, light from your home can make it easier for people to see inside. However, darker or more reflective films may offer some degree of privacy during the day. For maximum nighttime privacy, we recommend using dual-reflective films or privacy films that are designed to reduce visibility both day and night.",

      question: "Will paint correction remove all scratches and imperfections?",
      answer:
        "While paint correction can remove most swirl marks, light scratches, and other imperfections, it may not be able to eliminate very deep or severe scratches.

    },
    {
      question:

      question: "How often should I get paint correction done?",
      answer:
        "Paint correction is typically done when the vehicle’s paint shows significant imperfections that can't be corrected by regular washing or detailing. It’s not something that needs to be done regularly, but it can be a good idea if you notice defects in your paint or want to maintain the overall appearance of your vehicle.",

      answer:
        "If your car has been repainted, please let us know before we apply a Paint Protection Film (PPF). The paint must be fully cured, typically requiring at least 30 days.

Proper preparation and timing are key to achieving the best results, so consulting with a professional installer is important to ensure your vehicle is ready for PPF.",

      question: "How do I maintain my windshield after applying ExoShield GT3?",

      question: "Will ceramic coating prevent all scratches?",
      answer:
        "Ceramic coating adds a layer of protection against light scratches and swirl marks, but it cannot prevent all types of damage, especially deep scratches from sharp objects or accidents.
