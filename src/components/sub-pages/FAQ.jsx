        "Does window film increase privacy at night if interior lights are on?",
      answer:
        "No, window tinting or window film generally does not provide increased privacy at night if your interior lights are on. At night, when it's darker outside than inside, light from your home can make it easier for people to see inside. However, darker or more reflective films may offer some degree of privacy during the day. For maximum nighttime privacy, we recommend using dual-reflective films or privacy films that are designed to reduce visibility both day and night.",

        "Paint correction is a process used to restore the appearance of a vehicle’s paint by removing imperfections such as swirl marks, scratches, oxidation, water spots, and other imperfections that can make the paint look dull or damaged. It’s a highly effective way to bring back the original shine and depth of your vehicle's paint, ensuring it looks as good as new.",
    },
    {
      question: "How Long Does Paint Correction Last?",
      answer:
        "The results of paint correction can last for a long time, but they depend on how well the vehicle is maintained. The process removes imperfections in the paint, but it doesn’t protect against future scratches or damage. Applying a protective layer, like ceramic coating or wax, will help maintain the corrected finish longer.",
    },
    {
      question: "How Do You Fix Swirl Marks and Scratches on Car Paint?",
      answer:
        "Swirl marks and light scratches can be removed through the paint correction process. A combination of specialized polishing compounds and a machine polisher are used to gently remove the damaged layer of paint, restoring the surface to its original smoothness and gloss.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Paint Correction Remove Deep Scratches?",
      answer:
        "Paint correction is effective at removing light to moderate imperfections, but deep scratches that penetrate the clear coat may require additional repair or touch-up painting. In some cases, the scratch may only be minimized, not fully eliminated.",

      question: "How Can I Maintain My Vehicle After Paint Correction?",
      answer:
        "To maintain your vehicle’s appearance after paint correction, regular washing with pH-neutral car shampoo and a microfiber towel is essential. Additionally, applying a ceramic coating or wax will help protect the paint and keep it looking pristine for longer.",

      question: "Can Paint Correction Be Done on New Cars?",
      answer:

  "paint-protection": [
    {
      question: "What is Paint Protection Film (PPF)?",
      answer: "PPF is made from a durable, clear urethane material. This advanced polymer film is engineered to protect a vehicle’s paint from scratches, stone chips, UV damage, and contaminants. The film is designed to be both flexible and tough, allowing it to conform seamlessly to the contours of the vehicle. The key feature of STEk PPF is its self-healing technology, which allows light scratches or swirl marks to disappear when exposed to heat, either from sunlight or a warm surface. This unique ability helps maintain the film’s smooth, flawless appearance over time.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much coverage do I receive with Paint Protection Film?",
      answer: `
      While we aim for 99%+ coverage with our Paint Protection Films and it's important to note that these materials are not paint, and achieving 100% perfect coverage is not always possible. Minor imperfections such as slight lifting on sharp curves, rivets, seams, or edges—even on flat surfaces—can occasionally occur. These are natural characteristics of the material, and some flaws are to be expected. </br>
      </br> We carefully place seams in the material to reduce issues like bubbling or lifting as much as possible, but some areas may still show minor signs. To ensure you're comfortable with the final result, we encourage you to ask a Tint Tek Plus team member to give you a better understanding of how your vehicle will look once PPF is applied.
      `,
    },
    {
      question: "Does PPF Damage Paint?",
      answer: "Paint Protection Film (PPF)  should not cause damage to your vehicle's factory paint or repainted surfaces. However, if your paint is already chipped or the panels have been repainted, there’s a chance that the film may lift the paint or clear coat during installation or removal. Since we cannot control the condition or quality of your vehicle’s paint—whether it’s original or repainted—we are not liable for any peeling or damage that might occur during the process. We recommend ensuring that your paint is in good condition before applying PPF or vinyl wrap to avoid any potential issues.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will Paint Protection Film (PPF) look perfect?",
      answer: `
      Our goal is to always provide you with the highest-quality installation, and we are continuously evolving to be the best in the industry. However, achieving a perfectly flawless look can be challenging due to PPF being an 8mm film, not paint. Common irregularities, such as tack marks, stretch marks, or seams, are normal and necessary to ensure proper adhesion and a secure, long-lasting installation. </br>
      </br> Even with our skilled installation team, small imperfections may still occur, especially on sharp corners or concave areas of your vehicle. While we are always working to minimize these issues and improve our techniques, it's important to understand that eliminating every wrinkle or bubble completely can be difficult. </br>
      </br>In short, while we strive for perfection and are constantly evolving to reduce these imperfections, the nature of working with PPF means that some slight irregularities may still be present. Rest assured, you will still receive a top-quality result that significantly enhances and protects your vehicle. </br>

    },
    {
      question: "Do you remove any parts from my vehicle?",
      answer: "In some cases, yes, it may be necessary to remove certain parts of your vehicle to ensure a clean and seamless installation. Parts like mirrors, badges, or trim pieces are sometimes taken off to achieve a perfect wrap or film application. This step helps us ensure that the film fits precisely and avoids any potential lifting or wrinkles. Our goal is to ensure your vehicle looks flawless, and part of that process can involve removing parts to provide a more thorough and professional finish",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you do any corrections before installing PPF?",
      answer: `
      Yes, we perform a light polish on the vehicle before applying the Paint Protection Film (PPF). This is important because PPF encapsulates the condition of the paint, meaning any imperfections in the paint will be visible once the film is applied. Ensuring that the paint is in the best possible condition is key to achieving the highest-quality result. </br>
      </br> Once the vehicle arrives, we carefully inspect the condition of the paint. If any additional corrections, such as deeper polishing or paint repair, are needed to optimize the surface for PPF application, we will recommend those before proceeding. Our goal is to make sure the paint is in top condition so that the PPF adheres properly and looks flawless once applied.
      `,
    },
    {
      question: "Do you check the PPF after installation?",
      answer: "Yes, we schedule a post-installation check-up to ensure everything is perfect. After the PPF is applied, we carefully inspect the entire vehicle to make sure the film is properly adhered and that any bubbles, wrinkles, or imperfections are minimized. If any adjustments are needed, we take care of them promptly. We also provide guidance on proper care and maintenance, ensuring your PPF continues to protect and enhance your vehicle for years to come. Your satisfaction is our pr",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I PPF my car after a collision or having it repainted? ",
      answer:`
      While we always strive for perfection and take every precaution during installation, it’s important to understand that Paint Protection Film (PPF) can potentially cause damage to certain surfaces, especially if the vehicle has had previous aftermarket repairs, such as repainting, Bondo, dent repair, or work involving carbon fiber or fiberglass. During installation, the film is often aligned multiple times on the painted panel, and the strong adhesive on the back of the film can sometimes lift paint or clear coat—this can happen even with factory paint. </br>
      </br> We make every effort to avoid this, but if your vehicle has been repainted or has existing damage like chips, there’s a chance that the film could pull up the paint or clear coat during installation or removal, particularly in areas where the paint or clear coat is not well bonded or has been poorly applied. </br>
      </br> As a result, Tint Tek Plus cannot be held responsible for any damage caused to repainted surfaces or factory paint during installation or when the film is removed later. This includes any peeling of paint, removal of existing clear bra, emblems, or vinyl that might be necessary for the installation. By proceeding with the service, you agree to release us from all liability related to peeling paint or clear coat damage.</br>
      </br> To minimize any risks, we highly recommend ensuring your paint is in good condition before applying PPF or vinyl wrap. If your vehicle has been repainted, it’s best to check the quality of the paint job and confirm it’s fully cured and bonded to avoid any potential issues.</br>

       <strong>Proper Care: </strong>  To maintain your warranty, it's important to properly care for the PPF. Automated car washes should be avoided, as the harsh chemicals and brushes used in these systems can damage the film and cause micro-abrasions. We highly recommend hand washing your vehicle using mild, pH-balanced products to preserve the film’s integrity.

      question: "Ceramic Coating Warranty & Care Guidelines",
      answer: `<strong> Warranty Duration: </strong> The warranty for our ceramic coatings is valid for the entire lifespan of the coating you choose, provided proper care is followed.</br>
      </br><strong>Proper Care: </strong> To maintain your warranty, it is crucial to properly maintain the coating. Automated car washes should never be used, as the harsh chemicals and machines can damage the coating and cause micro-scratching, especially if brushes or abrasive materials are involved. We recommend hand washing your vehicle with appropriate products to preserve the coating.</br>
      </br><strong>Hydrophobic Properties: </strong> Over time, the hydrophobic properties of the coating may decrease. This doesn’t mean the coating is no longer effective; it’s simply a sign that the pores of the coating may be clogged. A decontamination wash will restore the coating’s performance and hydrophobic qualities.</br>
      </br><strong>Decontamination Wash: </strong> We offer a decontamination wash for $225, which we recommend every 12-24 months to keep the coating performing optimally.
