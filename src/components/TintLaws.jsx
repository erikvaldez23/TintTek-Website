const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is the legal tint limit in Texas in 2026?",
    answer:
      "Texas requires at least 25% VLT (Visible Light Transmission) on front side windows — meaning at least 25% of outside light must pass through. Rear side windows and the rear windshield can be any darkness. The windshield can only have non-reflective tint on the top 5 inches (above the AS-1 line).",
  },
  {
    question: "Is 20% tint legal in Texas?",
    answer:
      "No — 20% tint on front side windows (driver and passenger) is not legal in Texas. Texas requires at least 25% VLT on front side windows. However, 20% tint is perfectly legal on rear side windows and the rear windshield.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is 15% tint legal in Texas?",
    answer:
      "Not on front side windows. 15% VLT tint allows only 15% of light through, which is below the 25% minimum required by Texas law for front windows. On rear windows and the rear windshield, 15% tint is legal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a medical exemption for darker front window tint in Texas?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Texas Transportation Code Section 547.613 allows a medical exemption for window tint darker than 25% VLT on front side windows. You must obtain a signed statement from a licensed physician or optometrist citing the specific medical condition (such as lupus, albinism, photosensitivity, or melanoma). The statement must be kept in the vehicle and presented to law enforcement if stopped. Our installers can work with your medical documentation to ensure proper installation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do tint laws in Texas apply to SUVs and trucks differently?",
    answer:
      "No — the 25% VLT minimum on front side windows applies to all passenger vehicles including SUVs, trucks, and vans. The rear windows (behind the driver) on SUVs and trucks can be any darkness. Some confusion arises because SUVs often have factory-tinted rear glass, but the front windows still must meet the 25% standard.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my window tint is too dark in Texas?",
    answer:
      "An officer can issue a fix-it ticket requiring you to remove or replace the non-compliant tint. Fines vary by municipality but typically range from $25–$200. The main issue is your vehicle will fail the annual Texas safety inspection if tint is measured below the 25% VLT threshold on front windows.",
  },
  {
    question: "What VLT is best for front windows in Texas while staying legal?",
    answer:
      "Most Texas drivers choose 35% VLT on front windows — legal, provides noticeable heat and glare reduction, and still looks great. Combined with a high-quality ceramic film like LLumar CTX, 35% tint provides 88% infrared heat rejection while maintaining safety and legality.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do tinted windows affect my Texas vehicle inspection?",
    answer:
      "Yes. During a Texas safety inspection, the inspector may measure tint darkness using a photometer. If front side windows test below 25% VLT, the vehicle fails inspection and the tint must be removed or replaced before passing. Tint Tek Plus ensures every front window installation is 25% VLT or above to guarantee inspection compliance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are factory-tinted windows subject to Texas tint laws?",
    answer:
      "Yes and no. Factory-applied tint must meet Texas standards when sold, and most factory glass on front windows is 70%+ VLT. However, if you add aftermarket tint on top of factory glass, the combined VLT must still meet the 25% minimum. Our tint meters measure the combined result to ensure compliance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I tint my windshield in Texas?",
    answer:
      "Only the top portion. Texas allows non-reflective tint on the top 5 inches of the windshield (above the AS-1 line) — typically used for a sun visor strip. No tint is permitted on the main viewing area of the windshield. Instead, many Texas drivers choose ExoShield GT3 windshield protection film, which is optically clear and fully legal.",
