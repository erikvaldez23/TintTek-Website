    "question": "How much coverage do I receive with Paint Protection Film?",
    "answer": "While we aim for 99%+ coverage with our Paint Protection Films, it is important to note that these materials are not paint, and achieving 100% perfect coverage is not always possible. Minor imperfections such as slight lifting on sharp curves, rivets, seams, or edges—even on flat surfaces—can occasionally occur. These are natural characteristics of the material, and some flaws are to be expected. We carefully place seams in the material to reduce issues like bubbling or lifting as much as possible, but some areas may still show minor signs. To ensure you're comfortable with the final result, we encourage you to ask a Tint Tek Plus team member for a better understanding of how your vehicle will look once PPF is applied."

However, if your paint is already chipped or the panels have been repainted, there is a chance that the film may lift the paint or clear coat during installation or removal. We recommend ensuring that your paint is in good condition before applying PPF or vinyl wrap to avoid any potential issues."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will Paint Protection Film (PPF) look perfect?",
    "answer": "Our goal is to always provide you with the highest-quality installation, but achieving a perfectly flawless look can be challenging due to PPF being an 8mm film, not paint. Common irregularities such as tack marks, stretch marks, or seams are normal and necessary for proper adhesion and a secure, long-lasting installation. Even with our skilled installation team, small imperfections may still occur, especially on sharp corners or concave areas. While we work to minimize these issues, eliminating every wrinkle or bubble completely can be difficult. Rest assured, you will still receive a top-quality result that significantly enhances and protects your vehicle."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you remove any parts from my vehicle?",
    "answer": "In some cases, it may be necessary to remove certain parts of your vehicle to ensure a clean and seamless installation. Parts such as mirrors, badges, or trim pieces are sometimes taken off to achieve a perfect wrap or film application. This step helps ensure that the film fits precisely and avoids any potential lifting or wrinkles. Our goal is to achieve a flawless finish."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you do any corrections before installing PPF?",
    "answer": "Yes, we perform a light polish on the vehicle before applying the Paint Protection Film (PPF). This is important because PPF encapsulates the condition of the paint, meaning any imperfections will be visible once the film is applied. Once the vehicle arrives, we inspect the paint's condition. If additional corrections such as deeper polishing or paint repair are needed, we will recommend them before proceeding. Our goal is to ensure the paint is in top condition so that the PPF adheres properly and looks flawless once applied."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you check the PPF after installation?",
    "answer": "Yes, we schedule a post-installation check-up to ensure everything is perfect. After applying the PPF, we inspect the entire vehicle to make sure the film is properly adhered and that any bubbles, wrinkles, or imperfections are minimized. If adjustments are needed, we address them promptly. We also provide guidance on proper care and maintenance to ensure your PPF continues to protect and enhance your vehicle for years to come."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I PPF my car after a collision or having it repainted?",
    "answer": "While we strive for perfection and take every precaution during installation, it’s important to understand that Paint Protection Film (PPF) can potentially cause damage to certain surfaces—especially if the vehicle has had previous aftermarket repairs, such as repainting, Bondo, dent repair, or work involving carbon fiber or fiberglass. During installation, the film may be aligned multiple times on the painted panel, and the strong adhesive on the back of the film can sometimes lift paint or clear coat, even with factory paint. We highly recommend ensuring your paint is in good condition before applying PPF or vinyl wrap."

    "question": "What is ExoShield GT3 Windshield Protection Film?",
    "answer": "ExoShield GT3 is a high-performance windshield protection film designed to protect your vehicle's windshield from chips, cracks, and other damage caused by road debris. Made from a durable, optically clear polyurethane material, ExoShield is applied directly to the windshield to provide an extra layer of defense while maintaining clarity and functionality."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I Wash My Car Normally After Installing ExoShield?",
    "answer": "Yes! ExoShield is designed to withstand regular car washes. You can wash your car as usual, but it's recommended to avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbing materials that might damage the protective film. Hand washing or using touchless car washes is ideal for maintaining the film."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does ExoShield GT3 Change the Look of My Windshield?",
    "answer": "ExoShield is clear and nearly invisible once applied, so it won't alter the appearance of your windshield. It provides protection without changing the look of your vehicle or obstructing your view."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is ExoShield GT3 Easy to Maintain?",
    "answer": "Yes, ExoShield is low-maintenance. Regular cleaning with a soft microfiber towel and a pH-neutral cleaner is all that’s needed to keep the film looking great. The film is also self-healing, which means minor scratches can disappear over time when exposed to heat, such as sunlight."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can an ExoShield GT3 Be Removed?",
    "answer": "ExoShield GT3 is designed to be permanent, but if it ever needs to be removed (for example, when replacing a damaged windshield), the film can be safely removed by a professional without damaging the glass underneath."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does ExoShield GT3 protect against all types of damage?",
    "answer": "ExoShield GT3 significantly reduces the risk of damage from road debris, such as rocks and gravel, but it is not a guarantee against all types of damage, such as large impacts or severe accidents. It provides additional protection, but careful driving remains essential."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Windshield Wipers Damage My Windshield?",
    "answer": "Yes, windshield wipers can damage your windshield in several ways: They can drag dirt or road debris across the glass, causing micro-scratches; damaged or worn wiper blades can create friction and scratches; and using wipers on a dry windshield can cause excessive friction, leading to scratches."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Ceramic Coating?",
    "answer": "Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer applied to a vehicle’s exterior surfaces—such as paint, glass, wheels, and trim—that creates a hydrophobic, water-repellent surface. It bonds chemically with the vehicle’s surface to form a protective layer that offers enhanced durability and ease of maintenance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How Do I Maintain My Ceramic Coating?",
    "answer": "Ceramic coatings require annual maintenance to keep their hydrophobic properties refreshed. Over time, the coating's sacrificial layer wears down, so we recommend bringing your vehicle in for its annual checkup after one year. Cost of annual maintenance starts at $225."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I Wash My Car Normally After a Ceramic Coating?",
    "answer": "Yes! However, you should never use an automated car wash because harsh chemicals, brushes, or cloths can degrade the coating and cause micro-scratching. Always hand wash your vehicle using pH-neutral car shampoo and soft microfiber towels or a wash mitt."
  },
  {
    "question": "How Should I Protect My Vehicle from Contaminants?",
    "answer": "Although ceramic coatings create a strong protective layer, contaminants like tree sap, bird droppings, or road tar can still affect the surface. If you notice contaminants, clean them off as soon as possible to prevent damage. You can also use a ceramic-safe quick detail spray to gently remove contaminants without harming the coating."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I Use My Vehicle in the Rain After Getting Ceramic Coating?",
    "answer": "Yes! Rain actually showcases the benefits of your ceramic coating, as water beads up and rolls off the surface. Note that the hydrophobic effect is strongest once the coating has fully cured, typically 24-48 hours after application."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the Ceramic Coating Protect Against Scratches?",
    "answer": "While ceramic coating offers excellent protection against minor scratches and swirl marks, it is not entirely scratch-proof. It helps prevent surface damage from contaminants and environmental factors, but rough or heavy impacts can still harm the paint. For best protection, avoid contact with abrasive materials and maintain a regular cleaning routine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the policy on paint damage?",
    "answer": "Tint Tek Plus is not liable for any paint-related issues, such as peeling, lifting, or damage, that may occur during the installation of film or when the film is removed later. We are not the manufacturer or previous repairer of your vehicle, so we cannot assess any underlying paint issues. By proceeding with installation, you accept full responsibility for any risks associated with the film application."
