          What Is Headlight Tinting?
        </Typography>
        <Typography className="blog-paragraph">
          “Headlight tinting” actually covers two very different products that
          solve two different problems:
        </Typography>
        <Box component="ul" className="blog-paragraph" sx={{ pl: 4 }}>
          <li>
            <strong>STEK Light Protection Film</strong> — a clear, optically
            engineered film built specifically for headlight and taillight
            lenses, designed to protect rather than darken
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Smoked vinyl tint</strong> — a tinted film applied for a
            custom, blacked-out aesthetic
          </li>
        </Box>
        <Typography className="blog-paragraph">
          Both are installed the same way our automotive films are: precision
          cut, heat-formed to the lens curve, and finished with no lifting
          edges or bubbles. Many Plano clients choose one, and plenty choose
          both — clear protection film on the lens with a light smoked layer
          on top.
        </Typography>

          STEK Light Protection Film: Function First

          , STEK’s Light Protection Film is built from the ground up for
          polycarbonate lens surfaces. It uses an adhesive chemistry and
          optical-clarity spec that automotive PPF doesn’t meet, plus a
          UV-resistant topcoat that stops the cloudy, yellow haze most
          unprotected headlights develop within 3–5 years.

          Smoked Vinyl Tint for Style
        </Typography>
        <Typography className="blog-paragraph">
          For drivers who want a custom, aggressive look, smoked headlight and
          taillight tint remains one of our most requested upgrades — ranging
          from a subtle charcoal layer to a near blackout finish. It instantly
          changes the front and rear-end character of a vehicle, no
          aftermarket housings required.
        </Typography>
        <Typography className="blog-paragraph">
          Taillight tint carries a bonus benefit beyond looks: it adds a layer
          of impact resistance against rock chips and minor debris that can
          crack a taillight lens, which is often a surprisingly expensive
          repair on newer vehicles.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h5" id="texas-legal" className="blog-section-title">
          Is Headlight Tint Legal in Texas?
        </Typography>
        <Typography className="blog-paragraph">
          Yes — when it’s done correctly. Texas law requires headlights to
          remain visible and effective from a specified distance at night, so
          there’s a real difference between a stylish smoked layer and tint
          applied so dark it kills your night visibility. Our installers won’t
          apply a shade that compromises light output, regardless of how dark
          a customer requests — it’s a safety line we don’t cross. STEK Light
          Protection Film, being clear, has no legal restrictions at all.

          Plano’s <strong>Dallas North Tollway</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>President George Bush Turnpike</strong> see heavy
          construction traffic nearly year-round, kicking up the kind of
          gravel and debris that pits headlight lenses daily. Add Plano’s
          long, sun-drenched summers around Legacy West and Preston Road, and
          unprotected headlights age fast — clouding over and yellowing well
          before the rest of the car shows its age.
